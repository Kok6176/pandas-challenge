Summarizes the analysis (5 points)
I am performing Analysis on 2 input Datasets - School Data and Students Data. I am finding the District wise performance and School wise performance of the students in the given datasets.
The primary key metric, that i have based my conclusion on, is Percentage overall Passing Rate . To facilitate a reasonable comparison among the multiple school types and varied budgetary statistics, I summarized the raw input data into Schoolwise performance of students as shown below:
. Schoolwise summary on key metrics
. Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
. Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
. Scores by School Spending
. Scores by School Size
. Scores by School Type


Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
1. I conclude that CHARTER Schools are top performing schools compared to the DISTRICT Schools based on the key metric - " Percentage Overall Passing " .

2. The Larger the size of the school, the worse is the overall passing Percentage rate. Spending more on per student doesn't get the school a better performance in overall Passing Percentage rate either, immaterial of the number of the students in the school.
