## District Summary 
#### Steps 
* Calculate the total number of schools
* Calculate the total number of students
* Calculate the total budget
* Calculate the average math score
* Calculate the average reading score
* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
* Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
* Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)
* Create a dataframe to hold the above results
* Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

## School Summary 
#### Steps 
* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
* Create a dataframe to hold the above results

## Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) 
#### Steps 
Sort and display the top five performing schools by % overall passing

## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) 
#### Steps 
Sort and display the top five performing schools by % overall passing

## Math Scores by Grade 
#### Steps 
* Create a table that lists the average math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Define a function to take Grade as Input parameter and return a Dataframe having columns for school names and average math score for all students in that grade in that school.
* Merge the Dataframes for each grade into one Summary Dataframe and set the index as School Name.

## Reading Scores by Grade 
#### Steps 
* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Define a function to take Grade as Input parameter and return a Dataframe having columns for school names and average reading score for all students in that grade in that school.
* Merge the Dataframes for each grade into one Summary Dataframe and set the index as School Name.

## Scores by School Spending 
#### Steps
* Make 4 bins for Per Student Budget based number of students in school
* create a DataFrame with lists of Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Percentage Passing in Math, Percentage Passing in Reading, Overall Passing Percentage.
* Group by column Per Student Budget and find Averages on the columns of Dataframe.
* Format the columns of School Spending Dataframe upto 2 decimal places.

## Scores by School Size 
#### Steps
* Make 3 bins for School Size based number of students in school
* create a DataFrame with lists of School Size, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Percentage Passing in Math, Percentage Passing in Reading, Overall Passing Percentage.
* Group by column School Size and find Averages on the columns of Dataframe.

## Scores by School Type 
#### Steps
* create a DataFrame with lists of School Type, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Percentage Passing in Math, Percentage Passing in Reading, Overall Passing Percentage.
* Group by column School Type and find Averages on the columns of Dataframe.
